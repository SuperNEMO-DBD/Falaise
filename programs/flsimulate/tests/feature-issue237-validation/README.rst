Validation of the issue #237
================================

Test/validation scripts for the issue #237 about the new geometry realistic
model for the calibration source deployment system (SDS), associated variants
(user selection of calibration tracks) and vertex generators weighted by

The scripts test the ``Bi207`` primary event generators on top of a specific selection
of calibration source tracks.
