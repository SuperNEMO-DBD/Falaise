================================
Validation of the issue #241
================================

Test/validation scripts for the SNRS integration (SuperNEMO Realistic Source model, issue #241).

The scripts test the ``RealisticFlat`` and  ``RealisticSNRS1``
source geometry layout with or without magnetic field for the second option.

This is a rather long test because ``RealisticSNRS1`` source geometry option
demands a lot of CPU at the moment.
