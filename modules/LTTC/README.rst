Falaise Lttc plugin
===================

This  plugin for  Falaise implement  some processing  modules for  the
SuperNEMO reconstruction pipeline.

It  uses the Legendre Transform Tracker Clustering  (Lttc) algorithm
by  F. Mauger, a  library
dedicated to  the clustering of  tracker Geiger hits in  the SuperNEMO
experiment and track reconstruction for charged particles (e-, e+, alpha)

One clustering algorithm is available:

 * ``lttc`` : the Legendre Transform Tracker Clustering algorithm
