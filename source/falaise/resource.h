//! \brief   Utilities for accessing falaise resource/plugin files
//! \details The falaise library makes use of several resource files
//!          containing isotopic and radioactive decays data.
//!          Falaise also implements a plugin architecture, with
//!          several supplied as core functionality.
//!
//!          As these files are not compiled into the falaise library,
//!          a simple API is provided to return the root paths to core
//!          resource and plugin directories.
//!
//!          These paths are calculated based on the location of the
//!          Falaise library, allowing relocation of the Falaise
//!          package after installation.
//!
//!          The resource path may be overridden by an environment variable for testing
//!          purposes, and the use of the environment override may be
//!          queried.
//!
//!          If your application uses resources from Falaise,
//!          you must call the falaise::init_resources function
//!          before trying to access resources.
