//! Return the set of supported user levels. User levels offer differents

//!
//! Use case for Monte Carlo data production (FLSimulate):
//! - "expert" : This mode gives access to all configuration parameters
//!   and command line switches. It is reserved for very experienced users
//!   with a very good knowledge of the Bayeux/Falaise simulation framework.
//!   It is supposed to be used to explore, debug, commission new simulation contexts.
//!   No Monte Carlo data produced with this mode should be accepted in the official
//!   datasets. Use it at your own risk!
//! - "normal" : This mode gives access to a limited, but still rich, set of
//!   configuration parameters and command line switches. Users have the
//!   possibility to setup his/her own simulation setup for investigating and/or
//!   testing new Monte-Carlo configurations. This is the default mode.
//!   No Monte Carlo data produced with this mode should be accepted in the official
//!   datasets but each configuration provided within this mode could be promoted
//!   to an official one, after validation and acceptation by the Board!
//! - "production" : This mode gives access to a more limited set of configuration parameters
//!   and command line switches. Users have only the possibility to use blessed
//!   setups (registered through URNs). Strict rules for data production are used.
//!   This is the profile for production of 'blessed' Monte Carlo datasets. Only Monte Carlo
//!   data produced with this mode should be accepted as official ones.
