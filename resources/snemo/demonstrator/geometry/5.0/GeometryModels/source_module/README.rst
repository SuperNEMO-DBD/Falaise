Please do as you see fit for the ease of simulation. In the following,
I  give you  the  information  I have  on  foil  geometry. There  will
probably be too much detail, but  in the end, the demonstrator will be
close to  my description. I don't  know what level of  detail you need
for the simulations.   The LAPP geometry will be 8  pads between 2 Raw
Mylar foils : 133.5mm wide +2mm of raw Mylar on one side and of length
335.3mm +  7 spaces of  2.5mm of Raw Mylar.   The Mylar is  assumed 12
microns  thick.  The  total  thickness (including  Mylar)  is  between
275-325microns. The Se in the pad will be 55mg/cm2 (at least we aim to
be close  to this  number...). In our  recent R&D, we  had in  the end
between    45-56mg/cm2,    usually    53mg/cm2    (determined    after
preparation). The  pad is  made out  of 90%Se and  10% PVA.  The final
geometry, weight, density etc... will be  known when the foils will be
finished. The  two external  foils will  be scaled  down to  the right
geometry:  125-2=123mm width.   For the  moment, Foils  0 and  35, the
external foils will come  from LAPP, but out of the  36 foils, 3 foils
can be  made out of  something else (Cu,  Nd, Mylar?...). It  would be
helpful if the 2 external foils could  be one of these three, to avoid
multiple  foil cutting  processes. This  last part  with the  external
foils is not yet determined. So 22 foils will have the LAPP geometry.

Then 11  foils have the  ITEP geometry. I  give here the  numbers from
DocDB.  The  foils are  2700mm  long  without interruption  and  135mm
wide.  They are  made  out  of 92.5-93%Se  and  7-7.5%PVA between  two
backing   films  12   microns   each.  Total   thickness  is   between
200-300micron. The foils range from  36mg/cm2 to 62mg/cm2 depending on
Se availability. If needed, I can send you the table.

The demonstrator  will probably  have a  configuration close  to: 1-22
from LAPP, 23-33 from ITEP, then 0, 34 and 35 something else. Still to
be defined.  I don't know if it is important at this level, but the Se
is apparently not 100% enriched, so  the % and weight can be corrected
assuming about 97% enrichement.  Best regards, Andrea.
