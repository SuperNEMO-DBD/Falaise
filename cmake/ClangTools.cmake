.. cmake:command:: target_clang_format

  .. code-block:: cmake

    target_clangformat(<target>)

  :cmake:command:`Function <cmake:command:function>` that creates a new target named
  ``<target>_clang_format`` that runs the ``clang-format`` tool over the source code files
  of ``<target>``. The target is only created if the ``clang-format`` tool is present,
  and ``<target>`` must be a valid CMake target. If ``<target>_clang_format`` is created,
  it is added as a dependency to a global ``clang_format`` target which can be invoked
  to format all targets configured by ``target_clang_format``.

  The run of ``clang-format`` uses the ``file`` style to use any ``.clang-format`` file
  found in the source tree. If no file is found, it falls back to the Google style.
  Files are formatted in-place, so invoking the target will result in the source
  code be changed but should not result in any functionality change. Nevertheless,
  a rebuild and retest of the project after a formatting change is recommended.

  Any files in the target ending in ``.in`` are ignored. These are assumed to be
  templates for generated sources, and thus may have placeholder text that
  ``clang-format`` cannot parse.

  This function is intended to help less experienced developers with applying
  a coding style, but use of ``clang-format`` in editors and IDEs is strongly
  preferred.

  The implementation of ``target_clangformat`` is based on that documented here:
